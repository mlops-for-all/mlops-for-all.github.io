## Docker

To practice Docker, you need to install Docker.  
The Docker installation varies depending on which OS you are using.  
Please refer to the official website for the Docker installation that fits your environment: 

- [ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
- [windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

## Check Installation

Check installation requires an OS, terminal environment where `docker run hello-world` runs correctly.

| OS      | Docker Engine  | Terminal           |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| MacOS   | Docker Desktop | zsh                |
| Windows | Docker Desktop | Powershell         |
| Windows | Docker Desktop | WSL2               |
| Ubuntu  | Docker Engine  | bash               |

## Before diving in..

It is possible that many metaphors and examples will be focused towards MLOps as they explain the necessary Docker usage to use MLOps.
