Machine learning models can behave differently depending on the operating system, Python execution environment, package version, etc. To prevent this, the technology used to share and execute the entire dependent execution environment with the source code used in machine learning is called containerization technology. This packaged form is called a container image, and by sharing the container image, users can ensure the same execution results on any system.
